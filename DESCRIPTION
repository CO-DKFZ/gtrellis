Description: Genome level Trellis graph visualizes genomic data
        conditioned by genomic categories (e.g. chromosomes). For each
        genomic category, multiple dimensional data which are
        represented as tracks describe different features from
        different aspects. This package provides high flexibility to
        arrange genomic categories and add self-defined graphics in the
        plot.
